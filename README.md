# DFA-based Smart Building Access Control System

## Description
This project implements a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** based **Access Control System** for a smart building. Each restricted zone is secured by a **unique sequence of authentication methods**, ensuring secure, step-by-step verification. The system validates user authentication and strictly enforces sequence rules, rejecting any incorrect, missing, or extra steps.  

Implemented in **Python**, this project includes:

- **DFA design** for each building zone  
- **Transition tables** for all input symbols and states  
- **State diagrams** for visualization  
- **Test cases** covering normal, edge, and invalid inputs  

---

## Features
- **Zone-specific access control:** Each zone has a predefined authentication sequence.  
- **Strict sequence enforcement:** Access granted only when the exact sequence is followed.  
- **Error handling:** Invalid symbols, wrong order, missing steps, and extra inputs are rejected.  
- **Dynamic scalability:** Add new zones or authentication methods without major redesign.  
- **User-friendly interface:** Shows authentication symbols and available zones.

## Authentication Symbols
| Symbol | Authentication Method        |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| C      | Card Swipe                  |
| F      | Fingerprint                 |
| R      | Retina Scan                 |
| S      | Face Recognition            |
| V      | Voice Recognition           |
| P      | PIN Entry                   |
| B      | Biometric Combo             |
| A      | Admin Override              |

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd DFA_SmartBuildingAccess
   ```
3. Run the Python program:

   ```bash
   python access_control.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a zone and enter the authentication sequence.
5. Type `exit` to quit the program.

---

## Sample Usage

```
Enter Zone Name (or type 'exit' to quit): Lobby
Enter authentication sequence (symbols separated by space, e.g., C F R B): C F R B

✅ Access Granted ✅
```

**Invalid Sequence Example:**

```
Enter Zone Name: Server Room
Enter authentication sequence: C F R B

❌ Access Denied ❌
```

## DFA Design Overview

* **States (Q):** Represent progress of authentication

* **Start State (q0):** No authentication done

* **Intermediate States:** Each represents successful completion of a step

* **Accept State:** Full sequence completed, access granted

* **Reject State (qr):** Any invalid input, incorrect order, missing steps, or extra input

* **Input Alphabet (Σ):** {C, F, R, S, V, P, B, A}

## Testing

Tested with multiple real-world scenarios:

| Test Case | Zone             | Input Sequence | Expected Output                    | Actual Output                  | Pass/Fail |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1         | Lobby            | C F R B        | Access Granted                     | Access Granted                 | Pass      |
| 2         | Server Room      | C F R B        | Access Denied (wrong final step)   | Access Denied                  | Pass      |
| 3         | Laboratory       | C F R          | Access Denied (partially complete) | Access Denied                  | Pass      |
| 4         | Executive Lounge | C F R S P      | Access Denied (extra input)        | Access Denied                  | Pass      |
| 5         | Research Wing    | C X B P        | Invalid Symbol → Access Denied     | Invalid Symbol → Access Denied | Pass      |

## Conclusion

This **DFA-based smart building access control system** ensures secure, deterministic, and scalable authentication for multiple zones. Python implementation provides **dynamic sequence validation**, clear **state transitions**, and **robust error handling**, demonstrating a practical application of formal automata theory in modern security systems.
